usting whites since 2017 !

WhiteBuster will do it's best to turn all white backgrounds on the page to nicer eye -friendly colors ...

- Converts all background-color of rgb/a(255,255,255), rgb/a(254,254,254) to selected color preserving opacity

- does it's best to deal with transparent items, iframes and runtime created elements

Caveats:

- White background images cannot be transformed

- Badly coded pages that run code depending on background-color being white may break. (I haven't found any so far ...)
